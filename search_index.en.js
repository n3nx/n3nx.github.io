General for commit writing and specifications are presented in next section.\nMessage Structure\nThis message structure contains three relevant parts:\n\nCommit message header: the first line of any commit, mandatory for all projects.\nCommit message body: the description of the commit, necessary when there are lot of unrelated changes in a particular commit.\nCommit message footer: the footer of the commit, generally contains the signer's name and reference tags\n\n&lt;type&gt;(scope): &lt;description&gt; [optional issue tags]\n&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;\n&lt;optional body&gt;\n&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;\n&lt;optional footer(s)&gt;\n\nCommit Message Header\nComit\n\ntype: commit types defines the kind of the commit. This helps in classification when generating CHANGELOG.md.\nscope: commit scope names the parent folder in which the subjected file for changes is contained.\nsummary: commit summary briefs detail about the commit changes in general. Should be in present tense, non-capitalized and no period at the end.\nissue tag: commit issue tags refers to the issue number from the repository which makes it easy to check its status. These can be in multiple numbers.\n\n&lt;type&gt;(&lt;scope&gt;): &lt;short summary&gt; [&lt;issue tags&gt;]\n  │       │             │             │\n  │       │             │             └─⫸ Issue tags can be in multiple numbers\n  │       │             │\n  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.\n  │       │\n  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: containing folder of the file that needs to be changed. This is mandatory\n  │\n  └─⫸ Commit Type: new|fix|doc|imp|upd|fmt|chk|ext\n\nBelow this paragraph, all the different types have been explained with examples to get the gist of how to write better commits.\nCommit Types\n\nfix: a commit of type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).\nnew: a commit of type new introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).\nBREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.\ndoc: a commit of type doc identifies change in documentation of any part of the codebase.\nfmt: a commit of type fmt identifies formatting or styling change of the program (no changes in codebase when formatting is done).\nupd: a commit of type upd refactors production codebase (no changes in bugfix nor adds new features).\nimp: a commit of type imp improves performance of existing features and applies optimizations in codebase.\nchk: a commit of type chk adds missing test checks or fixes existing unit tests.\next: a commit of type ext identifies extra changes that affect helper scripts or external dependencies.\nbld: a commit of type bld changes to CI system, configurations, files and its scripts.\n\nFor example, below you can see the variety of types that are used to classify commit actions.\next(yarn): add package.json with necessary dev deps\nfmt(mizui): prettify all sass files inside mizui\nupd(core)!: rename classes `hidden` and `shown` to `hide` and `show`\nfix(defaults): fix content styling with formatting of other objects\nimp(comps): integrate muse in cards along with tag components\nnew(comps): add mizui styled checkbox component\n\nThese are self explainatory commits, giving you an overview of actions occurring here.\nCommit Scope\nThe scope, in general should be the name of the parent directory the file subject to changes is contained within. This implies to show the changes the file belonging to its location (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).\nFor example, below you can see underlined scopes that defines the commit location.\n    ________\nfix(defaults): fix content styling with formatting of other objects\n    _____\nimp(comps): integrate muse in cards along with tag components\n    _____\nimp(mizui): update `font-family` vars with change in few things down the road\n\nTo elaborate,\n\ndefaults defines the directory defaults in which changes were made\ncomps defines the directory comps where the changes in components were made\nmizui is the project name which refers to whole scope of project, referring to multiple changes made in various scopes of the codebase.\n\nCommit Summary\nUse the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize the first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nFor example, below you can see a sample commit that summarizes the details of changes made.\nimp(app): add user specific application components\nfix(defaults): focus outline showing at unprecedented viewports\nimp(comps): integrate muse in cards along with tag components\n\nNote that, the sentences are descriptive on their own having first words in present tense, none of the words are capitalized and no period is used in end.\nCommit Issue Tag\nUse commit tags to refer the particular issue that was resolved using the changes in this commit. Do note that:\n\nFor multiple commit tags, references should be inside the footer\nIssue tags should be in format [#&lt;issue number&gt;]\n\nCommit Message Body\nJust as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: \"fix\" not \"fixed\" nor \"fixes\".\nExplain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit message should explain why you are making the change. You can include a comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior in order to illustrate the impact of the change.\nCommit Message Footer\nThe footer can contain information about breaking changes and deprecations and is also the place to reference GitHub issues, Jira tickets, and other PRs that this commit closes or is related to. For example:\nBREAKING CHANGE: &lt;breaking change summary&gt;\n&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;\n&lt;breaking change description + migration instructions&gt;\n&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;\n&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;\nFixes #&lt;issue number&gt;\n\nor\nDEPRECATED: &lt;what is deprecated&gt;\n&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;\n&lt;deprecation description + recommended update path&gt;\n&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;\n&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;\nCloses #&lt;pr number&gt;\n\nBreaking Change section should start with the phrase \"BREAKING CHANGE: \" followed by a summary of the breaking change, a blank line, and a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.\nSimilarly, a Deprecation section should start with \"DEPRECATED: \" followed by a short description of what is deprecated, a blank line, and a detailed description of the deprecation that also mentions the recommended update path.\nRevert Commits\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert: , followed by the header of the reverted commit.\nThe content of the commit message body should contain:\n\ninformation about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: This reverts commit &lt;SHA&gt;,\na clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.\n\nSpecifications\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n\nCommits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.\nThe type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.\nThe type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.\nA scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):\nA description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string.\nA longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.\nA commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.\nOne or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :&lt;space&gt; or &lt;space&gt;# separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention).\nA footer’s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.\nA footer’s value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.\nBreaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.\nIf included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.\nIf included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :. If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.\nTypes other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: updated ref docs.\nThe units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.\nBREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer.\n\n","id":"https://n3n.org/foundation/commit-style-guide/","title":"Commit Style Guide"},"https://n3n.org/foundation/contact-us/":{"body":"The N3N code of conduct are the collection of 4-clause, easy to follow guidelines to always remember with a smile.\nCode\n\nDo your best\nBecome better version of yourself\nBe good to fellow members\nAdhere to N3N's philosophy\n\nContact\nThis code of conduct should be treated as a guide, not as the law itself.
